ðŸ§­ Business Understanding

Customer retention is one of the most critical challenges for subscription-based companies, as acquiring new customers often costs significantly more than retaining existing ones. Understanding which customers are likely to leave allows a business to take proactive measures â€” such as offering discounts, improving service quality, or tailoring communication â€” to reduce churn and increase lifetime value.

The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts which customers are likely to cancel their subscription within the next 30 days. By analyzing customer behavior, demographic data, and service usage patterns, the model aims to identify high-risk customers early enough for the retention team to intervene. This predictive insight can help reduce revenue loss and improve customer loyalty through targeted retention strategies.

The target variable, Churn, is defined as a binary indicator where 1 represents a customer who has discontinued their service during the observation period, and 0 represents a customer who remains active. The modelâ€™s success will be evaluated using key performance metrics such as Recall (how many churners are correctly identified), Precision (how many predicted churners actually leave), and ROC AUC (the modelâ€™s ability to distinguish between churners and non-churners). A recall score above 0.8 and ROC AUC above 0.85 will be considered indicators of strong model performance.

Ultimately, the goal is not only to build an accurate classifier but to generate actionable business insights â€” understanding which factors drive customer churn and how those insights can inform data-driven retention strategies.
